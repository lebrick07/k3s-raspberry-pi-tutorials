I just deployed production-grade Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi 5.

Not a toy. Real Kubernetes - same API as AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS. Running on my desk for $307 one-time.

THE JOURNEY

I've been running cloud Kubernetes for years, paying $150-200/month for environments that sit idle most of the time. Every tutorial points you to Minikube or Docker Desktop - simulated environments that don't teach real cluster management.

So I tried something different: run actual Kubernetes locally on a Raspberry Pi 5.

Within 30 minutes of installing K3s, I had a full control plane running. API server, scheduler, etcd, Traefik ingress, CoreDNS. Then I built a custom Flask app, containerized it, and deployed it with kubectl. Two replicas with load balancing. Real production patterns.

The cluster uses 15-20% CPU and 3GB RAM. Room for 20-30 more apps. Functional infrastructure consuming 15 watts.

THE CHALLENGE

K3s uses containerd, not Docker daemon. You build with Docker, then import:

docker build -t myapp:latest .
docker save myapp:latest | sudo k3s ctr images import -

That second command was the "aha moment." It mirrors real CI/CD - build in one place, import into runtime. This separation is closer to production than Docker Desktop ever taught me.

WHY IT MATTERS

Cloud providers hit you with bills. Minikube doesn't teach real operations.

K3s on Pi gives you real infrastructure you own. You learn ARM64 (AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon). You debug actual networking and container issues. You stop paying to experiment.

My Pi paid for itself in two months vs managed EKS.

THE RESULTS

Hardware: Pi 5 16GB, 512GB SD, passive cooling
Performance: 15-20% CPU, 3.2GB/16GB RAM
Cost: $307 + $2/mo vs $159/mo AWS

Skills: Linux admin, containerd vs Docker, image building, K3s vs K8s, deployment workflows
