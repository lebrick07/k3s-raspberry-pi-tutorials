I just connected my Raspberry Pi K3s cluster to an AI assistant. Now I manage it via Telegram.

🤖 One curl command. 30 minutes. Complete cluster control from my phone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What I Built

✅ OpenClaw AI assistant running on the Pi
✅ Telegram bot for remote access
✅ AI-powered kubectl operations via chat
✅ Proactive monitoring and alerts

🎓 Complete Tutorial

Step-by-step setup guide with screenshots and troubleshooting.

👉 FULL WALKTHROUGH:
https://lebrick07.github.io/k3s-raspberry-pi-tutorials/part2-openclaw-telegram

📖 Includes:
• Creating Telegram bot via @BotFather
• Getting Anthropic API key (Claude)
• One-command OpenClaw installation
• Bot configuration and testing
• Real usage examples

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why This Changes Everything

Most people manage Kubernetes through:
• kubectl commands (requires memorization)
• Dashboard UIs (clunky on mobile)
• SSH + terminal (not convenient)

Instead, I just ask:

"Show me all running pods"

"Scale the hello deployment to 5 replicas"

"The nginx pod is crashing. What's wrong?"

The AI executes commands, analyzes output, and explains what's happening. In plain English.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The Setup

1. Create Telegram bot (via @BotFather - 2 minutes)
2. Get Anthropic API key (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
3. Install OpenClaw:
   curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
4. Configure bot token + API key
5. Start chatting!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Real Example

Me: "Deploy nginx with 2 replicas and expose port 80"

AI: Creates deployment YAML, applies it to cluster, exposes service, confirms everything is running.

Me: "Check cluster health"

AI: Scans nodes, pods, resources, reports status with emoji indicators.

All from my phone. While sitting on the couch. 🛋️

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Cost

Hardware: Already have the Pi from Part 1
Anthropic Claude API: ~$1-5/month (pay per use)
Total recurring cost: Less than a Netflix subscription

Compare that to managed Kubernetes services at $50-100/month.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Security

• Bot token is private (only you can access)
• Telegram User ID allowlist (whitelist specific people)
• Commands run as your user on the Pi
• Full audit trail in logs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The AI Difference

This isn't just automation - it's AI-powered DevOps.

The assistant:
• Understands context ("scale it up" - knows what "it" means)
• Troubleshoots problems (reads logs, identifies issues, suggests fixes)
• Writes code (generates YAML manifests on the fly)
• Learns your preferences (remembers how you like things configured)

It's like having a junior DevOps engineer available 24/7 via text message.

Series Roadmap

Part 1: Raspberry Pi initial setup + K3s installation (completed)
Part 3: AI-powered multi-tenant DevOps - Building an automated provisioning powerhouse
